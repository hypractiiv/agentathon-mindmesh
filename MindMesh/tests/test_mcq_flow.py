"""
tests/test_mcq_flow.py - Tests for Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) and First-Try Explanation Verification.

Verifies:
1. Right answer on first try prompts for explanation to prevent lucky guessing.
2. Verified explanation confirms FIRST_TRY_CORRECT with high confidence.
3. Lucky guess without explanation fails into UNRESOLVED with low confidence.
4. Wrong MCQ option with high confidence triggers mismatch objection and follow-up.
5. All curated catalog topics provide 4 distinct options (A, B, C, D) and reference explanations.
6. Live internet fetcher synthesizes 4 distinct MCQ options.
